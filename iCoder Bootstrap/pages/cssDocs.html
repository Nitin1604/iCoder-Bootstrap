        <h3 class="mb-0 mt-3">Learn CSS</h3>
        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
            written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS
            is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>

        <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.
            This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification
            of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant
            CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable
            the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its
            formatting.</p>

        <h3 class="mb-0 mt-3">History of CSS</h3>

        <p>The saga of CSS starts in 1994. Håkon Wium Lie works at CERN – the cradle of the Web – and the Web is
            starting to be used as a platform for electronic publishing. One crucial part of a publishing platform is
            missing, however: There is no way to style documents. For example, there is no way to describe a
            newspaper-like layout in a Web page. Having worked on personalized newspaper presentations at the MIT Media
            Laboratory, Håkon saw the need for a style sheet language for the Web.</p>

        <p>Style sheets in browsers were not an entirely new idea. The separation of document structure from the
            document's layout had been a goal of HTML from its inception in 1990. Tim Berners-Lee wrote his NeXT
            browser/editor in such a way that he could determine the style with a simple style sheet. However, he didn't
            publish the syntax for the style sheets, considering it a matter for each browser to decide how to best
            display pages to its users. In 1992, Pei Wei developed a browser called Viola, which had its own style sheet
            language.</p>

        <p>However, the browsers that followed offered their users fewer and fewer options to influence the style. In
            1993, NCSA Mosaic, the browser that made the Web popular, came out. Stylewise, however, it was a backward
            step because it only allowed its users to change certain colors and fonts.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, writers of Web pages complained that they didn't have enough influence over how their pages
            looked. One of the first questions from an author new to the Web was how to change fonts and colors of
            elements. At that time, HTML did not provide this functionality – and rightfully so. This excerpt from a
            message sent to the www-talk mailing list early in 1994 gives a sense of the tensions between authors and
            implementors</p>

            <p>In fact, it has been a constant source of delight for me over the past year to get to continually tell hordes
        (literally) of people who want to -- strap yourselves in, here it comes -- control what their documents look
        like in ways that would be trivial in TeX, Microsoft Word, and every other common text processing environment:
        "Sorry, you're screwed."</p>

        <p>The author of the message was Marc Andreessen, one of the programmers behind NCSA Mosaic. He later became a
        co-founder of Netscape, a company eager to fulfill the request of authors. On October 13, 1994, Marc Andreessen
        announced to www-talk that the first beta release of Mozilla (which later turned into Netscape Navigator) was
        available for testing. Among the new tags the new browser supported was center, and more tags were to follow
        shortly.</p>

        <p>Three days before Netscape announced the availability of its new browser, Håkon published the first draft of the Cascading HTML Style Sheets proposal. Behind the scenes, Dave Raggett (the main architect of HTML 3.0) had encouraged the release of the draft to go out before the upcoming Mosaic and the Web conference in Chicago. Dave had realized that HTML would and should never turn into a page-description language and that a more purpose-built mechanism was needed to satisfy requirements from authors. Although the first version of the document was immature, it provided a useful basis for discussion.</p>
