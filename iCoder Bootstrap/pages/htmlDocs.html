        <h3 class="mb-0 mt-3">Learn HTML</h3>
        <p>HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the
            meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets
            (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>

        <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
            multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues
            for its appearance. </p>

             <h3>History of HTML</h3>
            <p>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN
            researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based
            hypertext system.Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That
            year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for
            funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed
            "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.</p>

            <p>The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on
            the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991. It describes 18 elements comprising the initial,
            relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid,
            an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these
            elements still exist in HTML 4.</p>

            <p>HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material
            into visible or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the
            browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of
            CSS. Many of the text elements are mentioned in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using
            SGML, which describes the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF
            command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system. These
            formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents.
            However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with
            attributes) rather than merely print effects, with separate structure and markup. HTML has been
            progressively moved in this direction with CSS.</p>

            <p>Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined as such by the Internet
            Engineering Task Force (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification,
            the "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which included an
            SGML Document type definition to define the syntax. The draft expired after six months, but was
            notable for its acknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images,
            reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing standards on successful prototypes. Similarly, Dave Raggett's
            competing Internet Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested standardizing
            already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.</p>

            <p>After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML Working Group. In 1995, this
            working group completed "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification intended to be treated as a standard
            against which future implementations should be based.</p>

            <p>Further development under the auspices of the IETF was stalled by competing interests. Since 1996, the HTML
            specifications have been maintained, with input from commercial software vendors, by the World Wide Web
            Consortium (W3C). In 2000, HTML became an international standard (ISO/IEC 15445:2000). HTML 4.01 was
            published in late 1999, with further errata published through 2001. In 2004, development began on HTML5 in
            the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), which became a joint deliverable with the
            W3C in 2008, and was completed and standardized on 28 October 2014.</p>
