        <h3 class="mb-0 mt-3">Learn Bootstrap</h3>

        <p class="mb-auto">Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first
            front-end web development. It contains HTML, CSS and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for
            typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.</p>

        <p> As of May 2023, Bootstrap is the 17th most starred project (4th most starred library) on GitHub, with over
            164,000 stars.According to W3Techs, Bootstrap is used by 19.2% of all websites.</p>


        <h3 class="mb-0 mt-3">History of Bootstrap:-</h3>
        <p class="mb-auto">
        <h3 class="mb-0 mt-3"> Early beginnings</h3>
        <p>Bootstrap, originally named Twitter Blueprint, was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter as a
            framework to encourage consistency across internal tools. Before Bootstrap, various libraries were used for
            interface development, which led to inconsistencies and a high maintenance burden. According to Otto:</p>

        <p> A super small group of developers and I got together to design and build a new internal tool and saw an
            opportunity to do something more. Through that process, we saw ourselves build something much more
            substantial than another internal tool. Months later, we ended up with an early version of Bootstrap as a
            way to document and share common design patterns and assets within the company. 4 </p>

        <p>After a few months of development by a small group, many developers at Twitter began to contribute to the
            project as a part of Hack Week, a hackathon-style week for the Twitter development team. It was renamed from
            Twitter Blueprint to Bootstrap and released as an open-source project on August 19, 2011. 5 It has
            continued to be maintained by Otto, Thornton, a small group of core developers, and a large community of
            contributors. 6 </p>


        <h3>Bootstrap 2</h3>
        On January 31, 2012, Bootstrap 2 was released, which added built-in support for Glyphicons, several new
        components, as well as changes to many of the existing components. This version supports responsive web
        design, meaning the layout of web pages adjusts dynamically, taking into account the characteristics of the
        device used (whether desktop, tablet, mobile phone). 7

        <h3>Bootstrap 3</h3>
        <p> On August 19, 2013, Bootstrap 3, was released. It redesigned components to use flat design and a mobile
            first approach. 8 Bootstrap 3 features new plugin system with namespaced events. Bootstrap 3 dropped
            Internet Explorer 7 and Firefox 3.6 support, but there is an optional polyfill for these browsers. 9 </p>

        <h3>Bootstrap 4</h3>
        <p> Otto announced Bootstrap 4 on October 29, 2014. 10 The first alpha version of Bootstrap 4 was released on
            August 19, 2015. 11 The first beta version was released on August 10, 2017. 12 Otto suspended work on
            Bootstrap 3 on September 6, 2016, to free up time to work on Bootstrap 4. Bootstrap 4 was finalized on
            January 18, 2018. 13 </p>
